# Event Manager

Following [jumpstartlab's](http://jumpstartlab.com/) tutorial to learn about serialization and working with CSV files and imperfect data. You can find the Event Manager tutorial [here](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html).

The goals of this tutorial are:

* manipulate file input and output
* read content from a CSV (Comma Separated Value) file
* transform it into a standardized format
* utilize the data to contact a remote service
* populate a template with user data
* manipulate strings
* access Sunlightâ€™s Congressional API through the Sunlight Congress gem
* use ERB (Embedded Ruby) for templating

This is a project for [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Ruby track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/file-i-o-and-serialization) for more information.
